                <p>You are talking to a friend who suddently looks at you and asks: "How old will you be in 2045?" Hmm
                    you remember the year you were born and try to do some calculation: Born in 1987 + 3 that's 1990. 90
                    - 40 is 50 + 5 thats 58. I will be 58! Wow that was painful! Let's fix that by making some code that
                    automatically does this!</p>
                <p>Create two variables called `yearOfBirth` and `yearFuture`. Assign these your own age and a future
                    year. What type will these two variables be? Using `yearOfBirth` and `yearFuture` calculate the age
                    and store that in a variable called `age`. Log out this string: "You will be 40 years old in 2027".
                    With 40 being the result of the `age` variable and 2027 being the `yearFuture` variable. (Hint use
                    string concatenation)</p>

                <p>The same friend (who by the way loves dogs) asks how old his dog will be in 2045. Hmm you think, lets
                    make this into a product as well! Dogs age can either be measured in dog years or in human years,
                    this we want to take into consideration!</p>
                <p>Like before lets create three variables but this time we call
                    them `dogYearOfBirth`, `dogYearFuture` and `dogYear`. We add an extra variable
                    called `shouldShowResultInDogYears`. If it is `true` we should show the result in dog years, if it
                    is false we should show it in human years. What do we call this type of variable? Now dependent
                    on `shouldShowResultInDogYears` log this string out: "Your dog will be 10 human years old in 2027"
                    or "Your dog will be 70 dog years old in 2027"</p>
                <pre>
    let dogYearOfBirth = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the birth year of the dog", "2000"), 10) || 0;
    let dogYearFuture = parseInt(prompt("Please enter a year in the future", "2010"), 10) || 0;
    let dogYear = (dogYearFuture - dogYearOfBirth) * 7;

    let shouldShowResultInDogYears = confirm(`Show results in dog years? Cancel if not`);

                <p>Two of your friends are considering buying a house, but cannot figure out what the right price should
                    be. Your friends know the width, the height and the depth of the house and the garden size. Lets
                    help them figure out if they paid too much:</p>
                <p>We have made our own formula for calculating the price of a house. This formula is VERY simplified
                    and not at all close to the <a

                <p>Your friend Peter is considering a house that is 8m wide, 10m deep and 10m high. The garden size is
                    100m2. The house costs 2.500.000. Your friend Julia is considering a house that is 5m wide, 11m deep
                    and 8m high. The garden size is 70m2. This house costs 1.000.000. Figure out if Peter and Julia are
                    paying too much or too little using JavaScript and the formula specified above.</p>
                <pre>
    // Peter

    }
